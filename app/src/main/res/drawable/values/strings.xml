    <string name="java">Java is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the
        distributed environment of the internet. It is the most popular programming language for Android smartphone applications and is among the most favored for edge device and internet of things development.
        Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ language, but it is simpler to use than
        C++ and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications
        that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network.
        It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a webpage.

    <string name="android">Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux
        kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
        Android user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely
        correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to
        manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to
        touchscreen devices, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions,
        Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface.
        Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.</string>
